# jalupa_config

> is my current config for [zsh](home/.zshrc), [vim](home/.vimrc), [emacs](emacs), as well as my scripts for [dmenu](https://tools.suckless.org/dmenu)

This branch is used on my Desktop

The [init.sh](init.sh) is a badly written script that will backup all files and create symlinks from the dotfiles folder.
The file is created so that modules can be easily disabled by commenting them out. Please backup your stuff incase anything goes bad.
